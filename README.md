Introduction

Say Yes To A Dress is a React application built for my Capstone Project. Say Yes To A Dress is for users who are on a budget but still like to get married and look amazing. It is a user friendly application that helps users sell their wedding dresses at a discounted price. The app allows users to look up dresses data from the database. You can add dress to your shopping cart. It also allows users to create, update and delete a dress into/from database. The app also allows users to search and filter the dresses based on designer name and category.
